Bred circa 1917 and first produced in 1919, Brewer’s Gold is one of the first varieties to
emerge from a UK breeding program by professor E.S. Salmon. It is an open pollinated
seedling of a wild Manitoba hop. Brewer’s Gold has a high resin content and provides well-
balanced bitterness which is ideally complemented by late hop additions in lager beers.

COMET
Developed in 1961 and released in 1974 by the USDA, Comet was selected for its high alpha acid
content and adaptability to growing conditions in the Yakima Valley. Commercial production ceased
in the 1980s in favor of newer super-alpha hops. Comet has made a recent comeback, finding favor in
dual purpose applications due to its unique “wild American” aroma.

EPIC
Found as a chance seedling in 1987 and grown as an ornamental garden plant until 2004, Epic was
expanded for commercial production in winter 2014-2015. The history of the field, combined with
the oil composition of Epic, strongly suggests that the lineage includes Alliance hops. Early brewing
experience indicated medium intensity, deep fruit and berry-like aromas without any citrus or floral
notes. Epic is an excellent late aroma hop.

Discovered as a chance seedling in 1861 and propagated by Richard Fuggle in Kent, England in 1875,
Fuggle was once the most prominent English hop. It accounted for 78% of production in 1949. The variety
is now grown in the United States, primarily in Oregon, and displays slightly stronger characteristics than
the English version. Fuggle is often compared to, and used in conjunction with Golding hops.
