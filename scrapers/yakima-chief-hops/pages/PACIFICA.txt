PACIFICA ™ BRAND
77-01

Developed by the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research hop breeding program and
released in 1993, Pacifica™ was bred through open pollination of Hallertau Mittelfrüh. It displays
classic Hallertau citrus and floral aroma characters but brings a blend of new and old-world taste
descriptors to the brewers’ forum.
