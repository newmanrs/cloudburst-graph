HUELL MELON
Bred at the Hop Research Institute in Hüll and released in 2012, Huell (Hüll) Melon was
commercialized as a new, German aroma variety in response to growing demand from the craft beer
industry for distinct flavor profiles. It displays bold flavors that are not associated with typical hop
variety aromas and has found favor in many hop forward, IPA and pale ale beer styles.
