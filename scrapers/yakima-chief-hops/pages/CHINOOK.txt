CHINOOK
Developed by the USDA breeding program in Washington State and released in 1985 as
a high alpha bittering variety, Chinook is a cross between Petham Golding and a USDA
male. In recent years, it has found favor as a dual purpose hop in the craft brewing
community as a result of its spice and pine aroma characteristics.
