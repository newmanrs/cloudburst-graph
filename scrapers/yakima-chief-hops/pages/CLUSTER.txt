CLUSTER
Cluster is one of the oldest hop varieties grown in the United States and until the late 1970s,
accounted for the majority of the country’s hop acreage. Its pedigree is unknown, however
hybridization of imported varieties and indigenous male hops has been suggested. Cluster is an
excellent dual purpose hop and is often used in the reproduction of historical beer styles.
