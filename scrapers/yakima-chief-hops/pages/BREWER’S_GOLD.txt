BREWER’S GOLD
Bred circa 1917 and first produced in 1919, Brewer’s Gold is one of the first varieties to
emerge from a UK breeding program by professor E.S. Salmon. It is an open pollinated
seedling of a wild Manitoba hop. Brewer’s Gold has a high resin content and provides well-
balanced bitterness which is ideally complemented by late hop additions in lager beers.
