MITTELFRÜH
Despite being grown in regions throughout Germany, Mittelfrüh is commonly referred to as
“Hallertau Mittelfrüh” as it was once the major Hallertau landrace variety. It is a classic German
aroma hop associated with Bavarian-style lager beers, however, due to disease, acreage has been
decreasing. Mittelfrüh is distinguished by an intense, pleasantly-harmonic bitterness.
