FALCONER’S FLIGHT 7CS®
BLEND


This proprietary pellet blend combines seven “C” hops and additional experimental
varieties. Like its predecessor, Falconer’s Flight 7Cs® delivers strong fruit and citrus
characteristics, but is layered with additional spicy, earthy overtones that allow it to
function as the perfect addition to American-style ales.
