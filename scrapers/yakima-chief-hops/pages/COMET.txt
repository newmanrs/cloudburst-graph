COMET
Developed in 1961 and released in 1974 by the USDA, Comet was selected for its high alpha acid
content and adaptability to growing conditions in the Yakima Valley. Commercial production ceased
in the 1980s in favor of newer super-alpha hops. Comet has made a recent comeback, finding favor in
dual purpose applications due to its unique “wild American” aroma.
