SABRO ™ BRAND
HBC 438 CV

Sabro™ HBC 438 cv. is the newest release from the Hop Breeding Company. Sabro™ is an aroma
hop that is notable for its complexity of fruity and citrus flavors. Sabro’s™­pedigree is the result
of a unique cross pollination of a female neomexicanus hop. With a robust brewing performance,
Sabro™ proves to be a strongly expressive hop that translates its flavor incredibly well into beer.
