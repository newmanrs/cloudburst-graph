BOUCLIER
Developed in 2005 as a cross between Strisselspalt and a UK male, Bouclier is the most
recent release from the French varietal research program. Its UK lineage includes Wye
Challenger, Early Bird Golding and Northern Brewer. Bouclier’ s combination of French
and English aromas allows it to bring a French touch to English-style beers.
