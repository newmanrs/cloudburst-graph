NORTHERN BREWER
Originally bred in England in 1934, Northern Brewer is a cross between Canterbury Golding and a
male seedling of Brewer’s Gold. It was originally grown in the North of England, but has become one
of the main varieties in the Hallertau region of Germany. Northern Brewer displays pleasant pine and
mint characteristics in dual purpose brewing applications.
