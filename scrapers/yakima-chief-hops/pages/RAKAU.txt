RAKAU ™ BRAND
70-4-9

Re-released in 2007 from the New Zealand hop breeding program, Rakau™ is often
described as “the whole orchard.” It is often used in New World styles where brash
fruity character and big but well constructed bitterness is desired. Rakau™ performs best
when used in combination of late additions and dry hopping.
