BULLION
Recognized as one of the first super-alpha varieties, Bullion is a cross between Wild
Manitoba BB1 and an English male hop. It was a major variety throughout the mid-1940s,
however commercial production ceased in 1985 due to newer varieties with higher alpha
acid content and better storage stability.
