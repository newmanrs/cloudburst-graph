SUMMIT ™ BRAND
Bred by the American Dwarf Hop Association and released in 2003, Summit™ is a cross between
Lexus and an unspecified male derived from numerous hops including Zeus, Nugget and male USDA
varieties. It is the first dwarf hop to be bred for production in the United States. Summit™ is mainly
used as a bittering hop, but does have earthy aromatic characteristics and subtle hints of citrus.
