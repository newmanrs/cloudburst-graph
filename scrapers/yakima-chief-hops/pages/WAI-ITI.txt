WAI-ITI ™ BRAND
HORT7709

Developed by the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research hop breeding program and
released in 2011, Wai-iti™ is a granddaughter of Liberty and is derived from 1/3 Hallertau MIttelfrüh.
Fresh peaches and stone fruit dominate the aroma in single hopped beers and when combining with
other varieties in late additions. Wai-iti™ is best known for its fruity, aroma-driven results.
