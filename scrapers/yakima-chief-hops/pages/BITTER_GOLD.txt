BITTER GOLD
Released in 1999, Bitter Gold is a high alpha variety with excellent aroma capabilities. Its lineage
includes Brewer’s Gold, Bullion, Comet and Fuggle. Bitter Gold offers limited aroma when used
as a bittering hop but delivers diverse stone and tropical fruit flavors in later additions.
