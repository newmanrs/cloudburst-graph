MANDARINA BAVARIA
Bred at the Hop Research Institute in Hüll and released in 2012, Mandarina Bavaria was
commercialized as a new, German aroma variety in response to growing demand from the
craft beer industry for distinct flavor profiles. It is the daughter of Cascade and displays
many citrus characteristics, however, the most notable aroma is tangerine.
