MERKUR
Bred at the Hop Research Institute in Hüll and registered in 2001, Merkur was the first mildew-
resistant hop variety from the research center. It is a cross between Magnum and German
experimental variety 81/8/13. It is a high alpha variety with low co-humulone oil percentages. In
some dual purpose applications, Merkur displays subtle earth and citrus notes.
