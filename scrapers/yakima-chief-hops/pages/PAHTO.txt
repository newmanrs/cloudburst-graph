PAHTO ™ BRAND
HBC 682 CV

Pahto™ is a super alpha hop that consistently delivers a clean and smooth canvas of
bitterness for the boil. The Pahto story is every bit as refreshing. Snow melt from Pahto
(the native name for Mt. Adams) and the neighboring Cascades provides irrigation for
farms and ranches throughout the Yakima Valley.
