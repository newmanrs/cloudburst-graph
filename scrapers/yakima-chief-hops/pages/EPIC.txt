EPIC
Found as a chance seedling in 1987 and grown as an ornamental garden plant until 2004, Epic was
expanded for commercial production in winter 2014-2015. The history of the field, combined with
the oil composition of Epic, strongly suggests that the lineage includes Alliance hops. Early brewing
experience indicated medium intensity, deep fruit and berry-like aromas without any citrus or floral
notes. Epic is an excellent late aroma hop.
