TARGET
Bred at Wye College and released in 1972, Target is a second generation selection from
Northern Brewer and a male Eastwell Golding; it is a cousin to Challenger. As a dual
purpose variety, Target provides strong bittering characteristics and is unusually effective
in dry hop applications compared to other English varieties.
