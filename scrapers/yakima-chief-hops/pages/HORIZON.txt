HORIZON
Bred in Oregon in 1970 and released in 1997, Horizon is a descendant of Brewer’s Gold
and half-sister to Nugget. Its low co-humulone is similar to noble varieties and provides
smoothness to beer, however alpha acid levels can reach as high as 12%. Horizon can be
utilized in every stage of the brewing process.
