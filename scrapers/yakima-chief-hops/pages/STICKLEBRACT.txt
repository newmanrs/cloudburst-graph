STICKLEBRACT
Developed by New Zealand Horticultural Research Center at Riwaka (now New Zealand Institute for
Plant and Food Research) and released in 1972, Sticklebract is a result of open pollination of New
Zealand First Choice. It was originally released as a high alpha bittering hop, but has become a dual
purpose variety characterized by citrus and pine flavors.
