CASCADE
Originating from the USDA-ARA breeding program, Cascade is an aroma-type cultivar bred
in 1956 and released in 1972. It was developed by open pollination of a Fuggle seedling.
Cascade is the most popular variety in craft brewing and is known for having a unique floral,
spicy and citrus character with balanced bittering potential.
