The new booster is out, the DOJ is digging deep, student debt relief is coming, and hop harvest is near complete - ALL GOOD THINGS! PLUS, NEW FRESH WET HOP BEER is going to keep coming out for another couple weeks! For this collaboration, our friends at Varietal Beer in Sunnyside drove us out 500 pounds of Citra from CLS\u2019s Wenas Farm, and that was super nice of them. We decided on a light malt bill of Pils and 2 Row to just let everybody\u2019s favorite hop express all that stone-fruity goodness, and my oh my did it deliver!

BUT recently we\u2019ve really enjoyed not clarifying them. While we\u2019ve never filtered any of our beers (because we don\u2019t own a filter) we do occasionally add wort clarifiers to our kettle and during conditioning to brighten the appearance of our beer. These things (irish moss, whirlfloc, gelatin, biofine, etc) occasionally work well, though their effectiveness isn\u2019t wholly predictable, and while making the beer appear clear is \u201ctraditional\u201d, they tend to weaken the head retention and lessen the mid-palate texture. That said, you know what else clears up the appearance of beer quite well? Time! Also, temperature! And that brings us to\u2026this beer. We decided to not use any added clarifying agents other than time and temp for this batch of \u201cKeller\u201d Pils, allowing Weyermann\u2019s Floor Malted Bohemian Pilsner Malt and Czech Saaz hops to exist in their purest form, perhaps with the slightest sheen of haze, much to the chagrin of traditionalists.

Some breweries are so prolific in their pumpkin brewing prowess that they not only attract attention from every beer nerd, but also Big Beer. AB-Inbev sees this growing market and wants -NEEDS- to be a player in it, so they start buying up independent breweries, one by one, slowly at first, then at rampant pace, until they confuse the consumer with so many options nobody knows who owns what anymore, creating customer indifference in ownership and operations and origins among the sea of SKUs, where only the deepest of pockets prevail, squeezing out small, independent, locally-owned and operated breweries until there are few left.\u00a0 In this Cantwellian Dystopia, THIS beer would be KING - a milk chocolatey base beer brewed with Libby\u2019s canned pumpkin and spiced with a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice and clove.

      "description": "Wanna hear a hot take? Black IPAs are one of the hardest styles of beer to make. Why? Well, the malt often clashes and muddles with the hops, plus esters, plus bitterness, plus lots of other things going on. The end result tends to be a mess. For every great version we try (like Firestone Walker Wookey Jack and Barley Brown\u2019s Turmoil), there are 9 that just flat out don\u2019t work. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve never brewed one\u2026until NOW. And we started with a twist right off the bat - we used a Lager yeast to ferment the beer cooler than usual, for a smoother/cleaner/brighter overall experience. And we paired it with a decisive hop bill that typically lends itself well to malt forward American beers - like Simcoe, but also Warrior, Citra, & Amarillo - for a piney/pithey flavor & aroma profile along with an assertive west coast bitterness. And thus, the Cold Black IPA is born. "

Why are we telling you all of this? Well, because this beer started out to see what two lots of Mosaic hops would do with one specific lot of Nelson Sauvin hops. But, nearing the end of a long day, 8 days after we brewed this beer, Steve carefully weighed out the hops for the dry hop addition, climbed up the ladder, and as soon as he finished adding 88# total pounds of Vista and Citra hops, an inner voice exclaimed \u201cWAIT! WAIT!\u201d..."

For us, they were assertive, rough around the edges, with a crystal malt presence that sometimes came off sweet and/or muddled, high perceived bitterness, unfiltered sheen of haze, with aromatic notes of grapefruit and pine trees and sharp esters. And while we look back fondly on these formative beers, if we were to replicate one, to the \u201cT\u201d, in this day and age, it probably wouldn\u2019t be all that great. Those are not fighting words - we\u2019re just being honest! And it won\u2019t stop us from re-imaging what they could\u2019ve been, with what we know now, twenty years later, and making one with all the things we looked back fondly on, while editing away some of those less desirable components. We hope this beer tastes familiar to you, but also, like it was brewed in the year 2022. "

As a result, we predict our fun differential to be maximal, optimal, and optimaximal- largely in part to the notes of ripe tangerine, papayas, mangos and corresponding higher percentage of alcohol by volume.

If we could just make more beer, we\u2019d be on the path of getting rich. But that means we\u2019d need to sell that beer to do so. So we responded to a few emails that claimed to only want a few moments of our time to talk about SEO and followers and brand recognition and vendor contact lists. They said, in order to sell beer, people need to find out about us, and we need to get more popular. We also need to optimize our exposure via online and in google searches, then we could attract influencers and post more pictures and videos of attractive people having fun while wearing our merchandise and drinking our beer. That would be ideal. Apparently, it doesn\u2019t even matter what the beer is or what it tastes like, the beer is just a vehicle to make more money, so we can get rich.

We needed to find this out, so we went to local trade forums and it seems like all these bros and bois ISO juice and sauce and thicc and smoothies and BBA and haze. We don\u2019t know how to make many of those things, but we put some of the ingredients we had laying around the brewery all together and made a beer. We even added some Cryos. And it tastes good!

But then we added a little Citra & Mosaic in the Whirlpool. And dry-hopped it with Citra & Mosaic Cryo.

And it was cold outside, so we didn\u2019t feel like walking down to Pike Market to pick up ACTUAL lemons, limes, and tangerines. So we used what we had available to us - and incorporated a blend of Citra, Comet, Motueka, Triumph, and Cascade Cryo hops. As for the alcohol, we needed to make sugar water and again, the source was right in front of our faces - why not use some malt!? So we did. And lastly, for body & texture, we added some salts and white wheat because we lacked sodium citrate or potassium sorbate. It is what it is!

And while the majority of modern hops have been selected and bred to our desired usage - there\u2019s a couple available to us that are essentially wild, found & cultivated by Todd Bates in New Mexico, the guru of wild hops. One of those ones? Well, it\u2019s in this beer. Zappa is grown at CLS Farms in Moxee, and growing/picking/drying it is a labor of (intensive) love. It doesn\u2019t want to trellis, it continuously flowers & cones, and the timing of maturity is much of mystery. It\u2019s flavors are intense and often clash with others - which is why we paired it with Citra in this recipe - because Citra plays nice with others.

To show you how much better Bill\u2019s is than ours...that said, we still think ours is top notch for an \u201cIPA Brewer.\u201d\u00a0 3. Bill doesn\u2019t package any of his beer in cans (just casks, bottles for $6 and 4l boxes for $35), so we can at least offer you an additional benefit of convenience. 4. To coerce Bill into an awkward photoshoot. 5. There\u2019s plenty of space to Dark Mild. If you drink it, and tell your friends, more will show up. #mildmovement "

But in 2019, word got around that Morgan was battling Multiple Myeloma and after a couple conversations, we agreed to bring this beer back, so long as the profits would go to Fred Hutch earmarked for MM research. Shortly after our last exchange, Morgan passed away. The pandemic was taking off and we were forced to table the beer once more, until we could celebrate Morgan - which is NOW! Like, TODAY! In the interim, our friends at Skagit Valley Malt got wind of a great cause and donated the malt. As for hops, it\u2019s the same bill as before -\u00a0 GALAXY (duh), CITRA, MOSAIC, SIMCOE and MANDARINA. On that note, a cheers to you Morgan - Here\u2019s to good people gone too soon, here\u2019s to hope and faith in scientific research, and here\u2019s to keeping promises to friends, past and present.

As one thing led to another, we thought it would be fun to brew a beer together.\u00a0 But not just any old beer - this one had to be magical. So we all started with a West Coast Hazy Pale recipe aka \u201cCellarmaker-Style Pale\u201d base - keeping the malt bill, pH adjustments, & neutral fermentation profile the same between the 5 breweries. For hops - we limited ourselves to 3 total varieties each: 1 old school variety, 1 new school variety, and Citra. The old school & new school varieties were blindly drawn out of hat for each brewery, and could only be used by one of us.\u00a0 We ended up with Simcoe (old school) & Talus (new school), which resulted in big notes of rugby red grapefruit, tangerine, passion fruit & pine.\u00a0 The other versions of this beer will be out in local markets this week as well - so feel free to try and trade some beer, via your own beer box, to collect them all!

BUT WAIMEA IS THERE, EVERYWHERE, FULLY TORQUED, SWOLLEN ROLLIN\u2019 RIDIN\u2019 VIBIN\u2019 BRUHHHH. Ok, that\u2019s not from the movie. But it could've been.

Well, honestly, they were probably pretty bad. Maybe ok. Rustic is a good word. Who really knows - they didn\u2019t have Untappd back then! (#burn) And that\u2019s not to knock them or their contribution to history. Just, a lot has evolved and improved since then - from raw material farming to malting to sanitation practices to hop pelletization to packaging\u2026.basically, everything. And NO, there was no corn used. What do you think this is, Whiskey?! While some brewers used corn back then, it didn\u2019t proliferate American lager beer until the 70s when everybody wanted water flavored beer. Anyways, we digress. We built a lager recipe from some old articles and style guidelines - which means, we used a fantastic and flavorful blend of Weyermann Floor Malted Bohemian Pilsner and Thomas Fawcett Maris Otter malts. And then we fortified it with some old school noble & american hop varieties - namely, Saaz, Mt. Hood, & Willamette. At the end of the day, this beer is bready- balanced meets snappy-crisp with a pleasant floral hop presence throughout that will leave you nostalgic for something your hipster great grandpa drank."

Hence, Elysian\u2019s Prometheus IPA was born when Dick opened up shop -\u00a0 which was an IPA that both Steve and Zach enjoyed drinking and brewing in the early \u201810s.

Not to obfuscate the plethora of hops that coalesce, this libation bonds an amalgam of Citra, Idaho 7, and Sabro of the humulus lupulus genus species. In conjunction with its proficiencies and empirical distinctions, attributes of Prunus Persica, Oro Blanco, Limettioides, and Cedrus Libani emanate. We express our gratitude to you for perusal of this superfluous chronicle and wish you enjoy this potation."

And we started getting in our own heads about it, because we CARED SO MUCH. It had to be just right and toasty and breadcrusty and caramelly and spicy but still dry and snappy. When push came to shove, we came up with a blend of Vienna, Munich, Caramunich malts (all from Weyermann) and hopped it with Magnum, Tettnang, Saaz hops and this is where we are right now. We don\u2019t always brew lager, but when we do, we play for keeps. Whatever that means. You get the grist.  "

It\u2019s deep, people. And so is this beer. We used Weyermann Floor Malted Bohemian Pils and hopped it with a bag of Saaz Special that Adam gave us, along with more regular Czech Saaz that Hollingbery sold us (we think those hops are special too).

And all the things you brew. They are named after Yellow.\u201d\u00a0 Coldplay THEN stole the press release and turned it into a multiple platinum hit single and the rest is history. Irregardless (this is now a word), we still remember when Amarillo was the IT hop, long before Strata, Mosaic, Citra, & Simcoe. So we built a modern IPA with 2 Row, Pils, Wheat & Oats around some beautiful Amarillo lots from Roy Farms and Crosby Farms. We sprinkled in a little Citra & Chinook to round it out - but this beer is all about Amarillo, and that juicy, bright citrus hop character. Oh yeah, your pith and nose, turn into something beautiful. For you, we\u2019d brew ourselves dry.  "

And as creatures of habit, this has been one of the hardest challenges of them all - predicting our week, our day, our afternoon. And of course, we use this phrase on the macro level as well - like how the senate should be power checking an authoritarian wannabe, how members of the house used to represent their constituents over special interests, how fellow humans still fighting an uphill battle for equality & justice, or how the attorney general used to prosecute all citizens that commit large scale, fraudulent crimes. But here we are, 2020, in all it\u2019s fuckery. While the world is far from perfect, and never has been, this IPA is the closest thing we can get to it this week. It\u2019s got a little bit of everything - mostly 2 row, some Maris Otter, and splashes of wheat & oats - and then hopped with Strata, Simcoe, Idaho 7 and Citra for some bright flavors of ruby red grapefruit, passion fruit, guava, & pineapple.

With fond memories and endless respect, they brewed a homage to the brewery that broke them in with this amplified, twisted version of the old flagship. White and red wheat, along with oats, give the beer its haze and silky mouthfeel, while the coriander, bitter orange peel, and secret spice drive the aromatics. It was then fermented with our French Saison yeast, making the beer finish fruity, dry and tart."

We loaded this up with Ekuanot, Mosaic, & Citra hops to ensure predictable citrus, tropical and spicy notes that everybody loves with a prominent, west coast bitterness.

You see, at first glance they tend to appear hazy - though we admit, that haze varies in prevalence from batch to batch, presumably at the decision of your brewers. Regardless, this haze is most often misleading - because your IPAs have a noticeable bitterness (how dare you!?) and they finish quite dry, even snappy. The flavour and aromatic profiles are often quite fruity - albeit with the occasional floral or piney highlight, and another note that some would describe as \u201cdank.\u201d  Either way, there\u2019s very little malt and/or cereal presence, another confusing facet that\u2019s cause for inquiry.  And thus, we ask for a clarification, per se, as to what style of IPA is that you consider yourselves. Surely, we don\u2019t want to assume you are constantly missing the mark in trying to create a West Coast IPA and/or a Northwest IPA  and/or a New England IPA. We don\u2019t get it. But we like it.

Lucky for us (and you), we found what we were searching for at not one, but two farms - Perrault & Loftus Ranches.

Narcose was amazed at the sheer volume of hops we were using - 255 pounds total at 17#/bbl - but in almost every other country than the USA, they don\u2019t use pounds to weigh anything. Nor do they use barrels. Because \u2018Murica is gonna \u2018Murica. In the rest of the world, they use grams and they use liters.

It\u2019s as if that since they are not as hoppy or as strong as an IPA, you can\u2019t like them as much as an IPA, and they certainly can\u2019t be as good as an IPA. And therein lies the issue - the comparison to a bigger, more flavorful yet similar style - when the standards should be clearly separated in the drinkers the mind. Pale\u2019s are their OWN THING! They are clean, simple, nuanced, bright, dry, and balanced.

And while this work is rock solid, the Lead Actress Idaho 7 truly makes this beer shine thanks to highlights of ripe pineapple and sticky resin. Supporting Actress Centennial offers an anchor to a classic NW profile - an admirable feat. And the winner of Original Screenplay, Hop 692, throws that tradition out the window - with the surprising, impactful notes of tropical fruit and cedar. And of course, none of this could be made possible with the producer (Corporate Ale Yeast) and Director (Rahr 2-Row) - both who tirelessly work behind the scenes and allow all the hops to truly shine.

At an undisclosed tun, they mashed in heated, fast, thick and frothy, the agitation activating little enzymes from within that neither knew existed. After some rest from the initial action, the careful extraction of wort and gentle sparge ensured that they were unified forever. But a boil was on the horizon. Intimate isomerization and raucous roiling ensued, culminating in multiple hot, HOT side additions of pungent, sticky, steamy hops. And not just any hops, but a trifecta of beauty and grace. There was the ever exotic, island dwelling Nelson Sauvin. A new starlet of small town origins named Strata. And then the A-lister Mosaic - a hop ever rising, yet far from climax. These hops would show up through-out the rendezvous, and not just on the hot side, imparting notes of passionfruit, gooseberry, pineapple, sex and candy. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. As the wort cooled, dollops of airy yeast awakened with intermittent breath, joining the affair. Rousing, rumbling in the depths of their fermentative rollick - it was 3 full weeks in heaven - everyday feeling a little more complete. But suddenly, the tank began to feel cold; ecstasy slowly replaced by a looming emptiness, leaving little time for goodbyes -- what felt like a premature evacuation. And maybe that\u2019s for the best, a quick clean finish\u2026."

AND EXPOSE YOUR PALLET TO NEW FLAVORS DERIVED FROM THE FINEST HOPS IN THE WORLD! But fine, whatever, we get it. So here\u2019s a DIPA with Mosaic and Citra and Simcoe and Galaxy and...Ekuanot Cryo (curveball!) that have all those familiar notes of dank pineapple and peaches and tangerines and grapefruit with our standard bitterness and dry finish. No, it\u2019s not juice; and No, it\u2019s not something from a pretty can; and No, it doesn\u2019t have trade value. But you can drink an entire pint, FRESH, and enjoy it more as it opens up in your glass. You\u2019re welcome...this time."

Creativity was about process - not about sourcing extract & chemically enhanced flavors, using random brewing aids, and children\u2019s cereal. And now, as you read this, some brewer in the universe has been reduced to making alcoholic water. FUCK THAT NOISE. We make beer here, and do it the hard way. And when we\u2019re inspired by a unique flavor profile, such as a Lillet & Tonic Spritz garnished with a lime wedge, we\u2019ll try to figure out how to make a beer that reflects that catalyst with traditional ingredients and an experimental approach. So, we started with a pale ale base that we hopped with Hallertau Blanc. Then, we added fresh lime and lemon zest to the whirlpool. And finally, we made our own tonic concentrate by steeping Cinchona Bark (a natural source of Quinine) and Lemongrass in hot water, deaerating it, and injecting into the finished beer once it was cooled down. Does it taste exactly like a Spritz or a G&T? Nope. Does it taste like a beer that is inspired by some of those components? Sure does."

The end result is a balanced, feel good beer with 16#/bbl of wetness that might leave a tear in your eye...due to allergies...or dust...whatever, we\u2019re not crying, you\u2019re crying."

      "description": "YES! Our FIRST of most likely 8 wet hops beers this season! We used 21#/bbl of Day 1 harvested Centennial hops from CLS farms. The ritual of brewing wet hop beers is an inherently personal experience between brewer and farmer, and every year, the bonds between us grow stronger. Last harvest found Shelley Desmarias of CLS Farms in the middle of her second battle with breast cancer. We were moved to hear her story with the disease and inspired by her positive, \u201cFUCK CANCER\u201d attitude. This harvest, we came back to find Shelley healthy - kicking cancer\u2019s ass a 2nd time! - while at the same time, Steve\u2019s mom had just been diagnosed with the same disease. It turns out, 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. So, we decided to make this first wet hop beer of the season count - Cloudburst will donate $1 of every pint sold in the tasting room will go to the Yakima Wellness House, a non-profit that provides health care services to women and families in the valley, and CLS Farms will also make a donation on every wholesale keg sold outside the tasting room."

It\u2019s hazy AF thanks to loads of pale wheat and oats, super soft & silky in part from additional brewing salts, with minimal bitterness because we only added hops to the Whirlpool and Fermenter. Who\u2019d a thunk that up a few years back?! We used an equal parts blend of Citra, NZ Cascade, and NZ Motueka for huge, futuristic notes of tangerine, yellow peaches, key lime, & passionfruit. It\u2019s a perfect example of the modernization of IPA, but brewed by two brewers with old-timey vibes, ardent work ethic, compassion for other humans and passion for all styles of beer."

Either way, we laid this beer down in 4 barrels from Heaven Hill distillery and kept them in our cooler for 13 months - tasting every other month or so, topping them off with fresh beer - until we decided it was time.

But occasionally, he\u2019d get heavy handed with the hop bill while making dark beers. These beers were hop forward but not like the modern iterations we taste today - think of them more as a precursor to the CDA/Black IPA/American-style Stout. A Vermont Porter isn\u2019t hoppy enough to be considered a CDA, but there are underlying notes of pine and citrus. It\u2019s got plenty of roasted and dark malt presence, but not enough body or weight to be an American-Style Stout.
